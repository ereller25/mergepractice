  <h1>I call it luck.</h1>
<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here
  now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my
  father before me. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I care. So, what
  do you think of her, Han?</p>
<p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Don't act so surprised,
  Your Highness. <strong> You weren't on any mercy mission this
    time.</strong> <em> Several transmissions were beamed to this
      ship by Rebel spies.</em> I want to know what happened to the
      plans they sent you.</p>
<h2>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</h2>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old
  for this sort of thing. I need your help, Luke. She needs your
  help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. A tremor in the
  Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
